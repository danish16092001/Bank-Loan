ðŸš€ Project Objectives
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on loan datasets.

Identify key factors affecting loan approval.

Handle missing data, outliers, and perform feature engineering.

Build and evaluate machine learning models to predict loan approval.

ðŸ“Œ Key Features
Data cleaning and preprocessing pipeline

Visual insights into customer and loan behavior

Machine learning model for loan prediction

Evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC

Easily extendable and modular codebase

ðŸ§  Models Used
Logistic Regression

Support Vector Classifier

Random Forest


You can easily switch models in the training pipeline.

ðŸ“Š Exploratory Data Analysis
The EDA includes:

Distribution of loan amounts

Correlation between income, credit history, and approval

Impact of marital status, gender, and dependents on loans


ðŸ“š Dataset
The dataset is taken from:

Kaggle Loan Prediction Dataset (or specify your source)
